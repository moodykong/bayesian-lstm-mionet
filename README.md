## How to set up the environment

I suggest to use Microsoft VS Code and devcontainder to instal the environment of this repo.

The devcontainer is configured in ./.devcontainer . Docker engine is required to run this container.

Alternatively, you can use local environment tool like pip or conda to set up the environment, and the dependencies are available at ./requirements.txt .

## How to train and test the model

I provide three notebooks for the workflow of Lorentz, pendulum, and Ausgrid dataset under ./src . 

Please refer to these notebooks for data generation, model training and inferring.
