## How to set up the environment

The recommended environment tool for this repo is the devcontainder extension of Microsoft VS Code.

The configuration file of devcontainer is in ./.devcontainer . 

Docker engine is required to run this container.

Alternatively, local environment tool like pip or conda can be used to set up the environment, and the dependencies are available at ./requirements.txt .

## How to train and test the model

I provide three notebooks for the workflow of Lorentz, pendulum, and Ausgrid dataset under ./src . 

Please refer to these notebooks for data generation, model training and inferring.
